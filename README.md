# ABANDONWARE!
Project dumped into the trash where it belongs...

## ExperimentalProject
Students' Collaborative Project for FIT3077: Software Engineering, Assignment 2 (right before the exam).
What it ~~does~~ did...

### Functionality
It started a GUI application that prompted the user for a Stock Exchange name (Market Identifier Code) in a simulated environment
via a SOAP query from Monash's internal server that supplied all the relevant data.
Once the user chose which Stock to monitor and pressed the Button, it would open up a secondary GUI application displaying a graph with a simulated Stock Exchange.

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate ability to create software using the MVC pattern. 
For all intended purposes, the programm does compile and run.[^1] It just crashes.

So into the dumpster it goes! üî•üóëÔ∏è

[^1]: to build you will need Eclipse IDE and you will have to sort out the JavaFX library linkage to make it compile.
